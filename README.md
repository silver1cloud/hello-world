# hello-world
I have run my own businesses since 1996 and understand how important the details are. As a customer your project will receive my full attention and I will do my very best to exceed your expectations. My websites are designed using the WordPress content management system (CMS). WordPress is flexible, widely supported, user and BLOG friendly. I use Google Cloud for hosting, a very secure and easily scalable platform. Each website hosting account is setup with Gmail and Drive storage. This provides a familiar user interface for website administration.
